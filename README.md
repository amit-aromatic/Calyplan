CALYPLAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program was made in Borland International, Inc's Turbo C++ compiler version 3.0 on a Windows XP (32 bit) machine at time around 2009

As on 2017, the 32 bit operating systems are obsolete and don't run the 32 bit EXE files compiled on above compilers. So to run these programs on 64 bit machines, following are the suggestions :-

(1) Install the DOSBox application to emulate 32 bit environment.
    * Visit http://www.dosbox.com
    * The compiler is already included in zip file turboc.zip

(2) Compile the included source codes in a modern compiler like Dev-C++ and change the source codes suitably for any compiler compatibility issues.

About Input and Output
***********************

Input and Output are from and to the .txt files kept in the folder as specified in the source code.
( C:\\CALYPLAN\\ )
It means that the Input.txt file should be kept in folder Calyplan in C drive.
NOTE : If you are using DOSBox to emulate 32 bit environment, then the "C drive" means the folder in which the C drive ("Disk") is moounted by DOSBox e.g. "C:\TurboC++\Disk" may mean the "C drive" in context to the Calyplan program

Output will be in text file calyplan.txt. Please scroll down and right in text file to see the output layout.
(as shown in enclosed screenshot)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although all known care has been taken to ensure that there are no bugs in the programs, 
however it is understood that these are not professionally made and tested. These are shared "as is" 
and it is upto user's discretion and judgment to use these for any purpose.
